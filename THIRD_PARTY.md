## Linked into the app (downloaded at build time, not included here)

The native `eboot.bin` statically links these. All come from the
[ps5-payload-sdk](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/sdk) and its
[PacBrew](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/pacbrew-repo) packages
(both GPL-3.0 for their own recipes and code); every library keeps its own

## License texts

`app/licenses/` holds the license text of every component above, with an
index (`app/licenses/README.txt`). The build copies that folder,
`LICENSE` and this file into the app, so they ship inside the `.ffpfsc`.

## Services and runtime

The app talks to Stremio's public services (`api.strem.io` for the account,
library and addon collection, `link.stremio.com` for sign-in) and to the addons
the user installed. Streams play directly on the console using the built-in
torrent engine or the stream's own link. PS5 builds do not require or select
an external Stremio streaming server. On the console the app relies on
[ShadowMountPlus](https://github.com/drakmor/ShadowMountPlus) (drakmor),
[etaHEN](https://github.com/etaHEN/etaHEN) and
[kstuff](https://github.com/EchoStretch/kstuff); none of them is included.

"Stremio" and the Stremio logo are trademarks of their owner. They are used
here only to identify the service this unofficial client connects to.

This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by or connected to Sony
Interactive Entertainment. "PlayStation", "PS5" and "DualSense" are trademarks
of Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc., used only to say which console the
app runs on. No Sony code, SDK, keys or firmware files are included: the
system-module stubs and the `libc.prx` loader shim are independently written
(ps5-payload-sdk, ps5-native-app-boilerplate).


## Application and UI provenance

The starting application is Sp9nky's unofficial-stremio-ps5-port 0.3.1 at
`64dd1e8ce8cf9eaac8291ff03fdad3e59255882e`, GPL-3.0-or-later. Original source
and component notices are retained. The Stremio Plus adaptation replaces the
RmlUi presentation and SDL video output with ps5-homebrew-ui and OpenGL;
RmlUi is not linked by this build. Its old license notice remains with
historical files from the starting project.

`vendor/ps5-homebrew-ui` is based on commit
`4bd942579dd981b3df9c740438489ca6a614ddc0`, Copyright (C) 2026 BlackBearReloaded,
GPL-3.0-or-later. Stremio Plus supplies its own application model and screens.
The vendor system-log hooks are adapted to use the app's redacted diagnostics.
See `vendor/ps5-homebrew-ui/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` for upstream component
attribution. That upstream notice describes the complete gallery: Stremio Plus
ships its sound effects and font assets, but does not link the gallery's
background-music player or include gallery music.

`app/hui/audio/sfx` contains the kit's GPL-licensed interface sound effects.
`app/hui/fonts` contains Inter and other retained kit font atlases and their
licenses. The additional `subtitles.huifont`, `subtitles-serif.huifont` and
`subtitles-mono.huifont` are baked from DejaVu Sans, DejaVu Serif and DejaVu Sans Mono,
Bitstream Vera license with DejaVu additions in the public domain. The font
source, notice and baker are provided. `third_party/stb_image_write.h` is
stb_image_write under MIT/public-domain terms and is used only by host
screenshot capture.

The native OpenGL SDK's complete notices and license texts are retained in
`app/licenses/ps5-opengl/`. Corresponding dependency source and build
provenance are supplied by the pinned SDK release; `BUILDING.md` records
versions and reproduction instructions.

The icon and launch background retain their upstream attribution. Film and
series artwork is supplied by runtime catalogs. The console screenshots in
`docs/images/` illustrate the interface; any depicted film and series artwork
belongs to its respective rights holders and is not covered by the code license.
